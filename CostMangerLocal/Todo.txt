1. create new schema (model) for Report 
   (it means create a model that would represents the report collection in the DB)

    the rout should contain a query string parameters representing the desire month & year according them report will generated (localhost/port/users/userid/costs?month=5&year=2022);

3. the hadler function of this get request will find all cost according userId, filter them and keep
   only the fitting costs  that was "created" in this month and year

4. after fitting costs were found, need to sum all theirs sums to a Total sum of all cost in specific 
    month & year and then build new report that will contains all the fitting costs and the total sum.
